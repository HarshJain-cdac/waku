"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — replies are presented, not dumped.

A real price answer came back as one run-on line of pipe characters in the NiT
UI. Two causes, one on each side, and both are pinned here:

  * the renderer had no table support at all, and joined a block's lines with
    "\\n" into a <p>, which HTML collapses to spaces
  * nothing told the agent to put a set of comparable numbers in a table, or to
    keep each row on its own line

Offline: reads source files, no browser, no model.
