"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the agent asks one question at a time, with choices.

Asked to procure pipes, the agent typed three questions in one message
(material, size and schedule, quantity) and the user had to answer them all in
free text. Now every missing detail is asked alone through ask_options, whose
choices the dashboard chat shows as buttons (plus "Other" for a typed answer),
and the next question comes only after the answer.
