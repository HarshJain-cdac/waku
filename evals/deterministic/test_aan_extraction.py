"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — an uploaded AAN answers the wizard's questions.

Four bugs made an AAN upload extract nothing, so the wizard asked all 37
questions by hand including the ones in the file the user had just uploaded.
Each has a case here that fails without its fix.

Offline: the AAN is built in-memory with python-docx, and extraction is
deterministic label matching, so nothing here needs a model or a network.

The text is read by waku/nam/docs/parse.py, the one parser for every
uploaded document. (The dashboard's own _extract_text and _EXTRACT_FIELDS
were removed in plan Step 5, and the NIT wizard's question lists
(waku/tools/nit_flows.py) before that; the cases that checked answers
against those lists went with them.)
