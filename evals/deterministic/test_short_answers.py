"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — "yes", "ok", "go" continue the conversation.

The officer was drafting a NIT; Waku asked "Should I generate the NIT?" and
the officer said "ok". The intent node read "ok" as a greeting and answered
with the canned hello, so the flow restarted (0 iterations, no history). Now
a short answer after Waku has replied goes to the full loop with the chat so
far; only before the first reply is it small talk. And a skill name called as
a tool ('procurement/nit-generation') gets a hint naming the real tools.
