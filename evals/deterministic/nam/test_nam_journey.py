"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the agent knows where a case is on the PR journey.

The PR Creation Flow (Need Identification -> Estimate creation -> PR
Creation) is laid over the harness's stages in policy/journey.json, and
waku/nam/journey.py reads every step's state from the case itself. A Goods
case is driven through the real harness (nam_fakes, no model) and at each
point the journey must say what was done, the step now, what the user still
has to give and what comes next. The same facts reach case.status, the
workflow view, the chat's system prompt and the driver's reply.
