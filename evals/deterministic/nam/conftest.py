"""The NAM evals' shared setting: need capture's detail questions (PR flow
1(e), policy/guided_forms.json "capture") are off unless a test asks for
them with @pytest.mark.capture_details.

Most evals walk a case to a later stage and answer only the question that
tells the past tenders apart; what they check comes after capture. The evals
of the details themselves (test_nam_capture_flow.py) turn them on.
