"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the chat stops at the matching tender (waku/nam/scope.py).

The officers' ask: "first give a final tender which matches the requirement;
remove the questions it asks, what type of tender and codified or non
codified, we are not up to that step right now". With WAKU_NAM_STOP_AT=tender
(the default) the chat asks only what tells the past tenders apart, then
shows what is left; no tender type, sub-type, detail, quantity, estimate or
PR question follows. WAKU_NAM_STOP_AT=pr gives the whole flow back.
