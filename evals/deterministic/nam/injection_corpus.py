"""The injection eval set (plan Step 12): hostile texts, each with the kind of
finding waku/nam/guard.py must make, and benign procurement text it must not
flag.

The hostile texts are what a document, a KG record or a user message could
carry to steer a model: overrides, role markers, prompt and key requests,
tool and action calls, exfiltration links, hidden characters, and secrets.
The benign texts are real tender wording that looks close to them ("shall
act as", "ignore minor deviations", "uploaded on https://..."), so a
detector that flags them would flag every NRL tender.
