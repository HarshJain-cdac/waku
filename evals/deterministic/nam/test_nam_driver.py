"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the harness asks Need capture's follow-up questions,
whatever model is loaded.

With Ministral, "i need Bimetallic TG 0-200 °C" got a rate table and no
question: the follow-ups ran only when the model chose to call
nam_capture_need. Now a stated need, and each answer to the open question,
run in code (waku/nam/drive.py). The questions themselves still come from
the KG tenders (followup.py), not from a script. Proved here with a model
that never calls a tool.
