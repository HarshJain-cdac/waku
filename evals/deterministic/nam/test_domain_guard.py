"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the agent stays on NRL procurement work (waku/nam/domain.py).

"who is shah rukh khan" got a film biography. The first fix put word lists
and a fixed reply in front of the agent, and "capillary", an item NRL buys,
was refused before the agent or the KG saw it. Now every message reaches the
agent, whose instructions say to ask the KG before deciding a message is not
work; after a turn with no tool, the small model checks whether the reply
answered something else from general knowledge, and a strayed reply goes back
to the agent once. Every word of the reply is the agent's.
