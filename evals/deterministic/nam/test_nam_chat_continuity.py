"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — a procurement does not loop when the chat changes hands.

Live, 2026-11-05: "procure bimetaliic" opened NAM-2026-0129 and asked its
category; the officer's "Goods" came in a new chat, which had no case, so the
model took the turn, opened a case named "Goods", asked options of its own
("Pipe, Valve, Chemical, Equipment"), and every answer opened another case.
Now: a case the model's tool opens is the chat's; a new chat sees the case
another chat left open, and an answer to its question carries it on; a need
nothing matched offers the items the KG holds nearest to it, never a
question about its category.
