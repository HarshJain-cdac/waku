"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the quantity and estimate steps do not wait on the
KG's price records one line at a time.

On the live KG a price lookup takes ~40s. "Finalise the quantity" asked one
per line with no quantity, one after another (10 lines: minutes, and the
screen showed nothing); the estimate did the same for every line. Now the
quantity's suggestions run in parallel within a budget (they are shown,
never applied), and the estimate fetches every line's records in parallel
before its cited calls read them.
