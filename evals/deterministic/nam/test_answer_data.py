"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — a model change does not change the data in an answer.

Two models answered the same KG question with different amounts of data: one
kept the comparison table and both tenders, another one tender and rounded
rates. Now every model call is sampled the same way (temperature 0, a fixed
seed), and after each turn the harness checks the reply against the KG tools'
output, adding what it left out under "Data from the KG"
(waku/nam/answer_data.py). A terse model and a wordy one end with the same
tenders and the same figures.
