"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the tender archive behind a case reference.

nit-forge-ui/src/lib/tender-ref.ts turns "PUR-MNTPLN-1005566" in a conversation
into a link to /api/tender/<case>/nit.pdf. That makes a citation checkable
instead of merely quotable, which is the whole basis on which this system asks
to be trusted — so the route has to serve the real notice, refuse anything
outside the corpus, and give one honest miss state.

Offline: paths are checked, not fetched.
