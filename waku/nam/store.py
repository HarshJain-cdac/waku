"""The Need Record store: one versioned row per case, and every version kept.

    nam_cases          the current record of each case: its tenant, version,
                       stage and the need itself (record_json)
    nam_case_versions  one row per version: who wrote it, from which flow and
                       run, why, which fields changed, and the whole record as
                       it was then
    nam_counters       the case-number counter, one row per year

This replaces nam_needs as the one place a case lives. waku/nam/need.py's
load() and save() read and write here, so the harness, the dashboard and the
chat tool all see the same record. nam_needs is kept as it was: its rows are
copied here the first time the store is opened, and nothing deletes it.

Writes are optimistic: a record carries the version it was read at, and a
save made against an older version is refused with stale_version (409,
retryable), never applied over the newer one.

Who writes is taken from the acting() context that waku.nam.run() sets for
each call. Code outside a harness call (the dashboard's older routes, the
chat tool) writes as the tenant "local".
