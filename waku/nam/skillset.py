"""The NAM knowledge skills (waku/nam/skills/<name>/SKILL.md), as topics.

Two skills hold all of it: nam-documents (PQC, SCC, technical
specification, BOQ, approval note, and the extraction rules every document
follows) and nrl-procurement (NRL's goods, works and services manuals). Each
subject is a topic: a `## ` section whose first line is `terms: ...`, the
words that name it (waku/memory/procedural/loader.py). A document topic is
written in four parts, `What:`, `Extract:`, `How:` and `Checks:`.

The Waku chat agent loads the same files (waku.memory.bundled_skill_dirs) and
reads only the topics a message names, so a PQC question costs the PQC part,
not the whole skill. One copy: the chat and the harness cannot disagree about
what a PQC is. evals/deterministic/test_skill_triggers.py checks each skill
loads first on its own messages and never on an everyday one.

Used by:
  case.ask           "what is a PQC", "what do we extract from an SCC": the
                     topic's own part, cited as skill:<skill>/<topic>
  docs.review        the model of the review task is given the checks of
                     the topics of the documents it reviews
  extract.py         implements each topic's "Extract" part in code
