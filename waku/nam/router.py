"""Which NAM flow a call runs, decided in code from the short system prompt
and the case's stage (plan section 3, "Routing").

In this order, the first rule that decides wins:

  answer     the caller answered the router's own "which step?" question
  explicit   the prompt names a flow id ("run estimate.goods")
  resume     the caller answered the open question of the flow that asked it
  boundary   the prompt asks for work after the NIT handoff (R33): refused
  intent     the phrasings in playbooks/catalog.py, scored; a tie is broken
             by the case's stage, then by its category (Goods -> estimate.goods,
             Services -> estimate.wage, Works -> estimate.works)
  continue   "continue", "next step": the next flow for the case's stage
  words      no intent in the prompt ("flowless" work, intent.py): the last
             user message read for what it is. A question, a greeting, "show
             me ..." with no case, or "approve it" is answered without a step
             (case.ask); "go ahead" continues the to-do list or the stage's
             next step; a change in words ("make it 35 nos") goes to the step
             of the case's stage that takes it; a tender named with "use" or
             "instead" is a precedent selection
  message    the same scoring as the prompt's, on the last user message
  need       no case, and the message states something to procure: need
             capture opens the case
  refused    no case, and nothing in the call is about procurement
  model      still ambiguous: one model call picks from a closed list of flow
             ids, and an answer outside that list is ignored
  otherwise  needs_input: a question offering the candidate flows

Everything but the model step is deterministic, so the routing eval can pin
every phrasing to its flow.
