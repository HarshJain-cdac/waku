"""The feedback loop around every step: what a step claims is checked in code
against what the case now holds, before the reply goes out.

A flow says how it ended (ok, needs_input, ...). That is a claim. After the
guardrails took its artifacts and the stage machine settled the case, step()
reads the case back and checks:

  every step
    recorded        each artifact the step produced is on the case, written
                    by this flow in this call
    schema          each one is still inside its schema (schemas/artifact.*)
    cited           none of its facts is without a source (knowledge.uncited)
    stored          every document it names (doc_id, version) is in the
                    document store, and its file matches its hash
    answerable      a step that needs input says what: a question, a next
                    step or a warning, never a dead end
  a step that says ok, its own "done" (DONE below)
    e.g. estimate.goods: every line priced, of the quantity now finalised;
    pr.build: no mandatory field missing; validate: the validation passed and
    is of the documents as they are now

When a check fails, the step is not reported as done: "ok" becomes
"needs_input", the failed checks are warnings, and the step is offered
again in `next`. The reply always carries the result as `verification`:
{passed, checks: [{name, ok, says}], stage_needs: what the case's stage
still needs}, so the caller (and the officer) sees what was verified and
what is left, every step.

case() checks the whole case before the two acts nothing can follow back
(guardrails.before_action, freeze_package and handoff_nit): every artifact
inside its schema and cited, every document file intact, each artifact of
the inputs it was built on (estimate of the quantity, documents of the
estimate, validation of the documents), and the audit chain unbroken. Each
problem names the flow that owns it, to run again.
