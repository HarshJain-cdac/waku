"""The agent stays on NRL procurement work (WAKU_DOMAIN_ONLY).

This Waku is NRL's procurement assistant. "Who is Shah Rukh Khan" once got a
film biography. The first fix put word lists and a fixed reply in front of
the agent, and "capillary", an item NRL buys, was refused before the agent
or the knowledge graph ever saw it. A rule cannot know every item; the KG
can, and the agent can ask it.

So the agent decides, and the harness checks:

  scope()   the agent's instructions (session.py): it is NRL's procurement
            assistant; a word or name it does not know (an item, a
            material, an abbreviation) is looked up in the KG before it
            concludes the message is not work; only a request that is truly
            unrelated is declined, in its own words, pointing back to what
            it can do.
  review()  after a turn that used no tool, the small model's "domain" task
            reads the message and the reply and says whether the reply
            answered a request that is not procurement work from general
            knowledge ("strayed") or not ("ok"), and nothing else. A strayed
            reply is sent back to the agent once with REDO; the agent writes
            the new reply. A slow or absent model, or a reply that is not
            one of the two, leaves the reply as it was.

Nothing here writes the officer's reply: every word of it is the agent's.
