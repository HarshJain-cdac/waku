"""NAM step 1, Need capture: one sentence in, every related past tender out.

The officer states a need ("i need to procure pipes"). This step scans the
whole knowledge graph for it, sorts what it finds by how related it really is,
writes a compact account into the need's dossier (see nam_dossier.py), and
decides whether NAM now knows enough to move on to the References step.

WHAT "SCAN THE WHOLE GRAPH" MEANS HERE
--------------------------------------
Two lanes, run in parallel:

  lexical   /api/kg/tenders walks every Tender -> Item edge in the graph and
            returns each tender whose subject or line items name the thing.
            Complete, literal, about a second.
  semantic  /api/kg/precedent, the embedding search. It finds what the words
            miss ("tubes" for "pipes") and takes ~15s. When it is down, the
            lexical lane still gives a complete literal answer, and the dossier
            says the semantic lane was off.

WHAT COUNTS AS RELATED
----------------------
The lexical lane searches for the HEAD of the need (the thing itself: "pipes"
in "carbon steel pipes for RTA"), not every word. Searching every word matches
"steel" in "stainless steel valves". Each tender found then falls in one tier:

  direct       its subject names the thing: it was a procurement OF it
  line items   it bought the thing as 3+ line items, or the semantic lane
               matched one of its items: it procured it inside a larger job
  incidental   1-2 line items mention it and nothing else does. Listed by
               number in the dossier so nothing is hidden, never shown as related

READY FOR REFERENCES
--------------------
NAM moves on when at least one related tender carries BOQ lines AND clauses
(PQC, SCC or specs): that is material the next steps can be built from. A need
with no related tender, or only related tenders that hold nothing, stays in
capture, and the response says what to add.
