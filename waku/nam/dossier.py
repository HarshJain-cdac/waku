"""The NAM dossier — one runtime Markdown file per need, filled step by step.

A need travels through several NAM steps (Need capture, then References, and
the ones after). Each step learns something from the knowledge graph, and the
officer and the agent both need to see all of it in one place, in the order it
was learned. The dossier is that place: `.waku/nam/<NEED-ID>.md`.

It is deliberately compact. A step writes what it found in a few lines and a
table, never a raw API response: the file is read by a person reviewing the
case and fed back to the model on later steps, and both pay for every line.

HOW THE FILE IS BUILT
---------------------
A header (need id, requirement, stage, times) followed by one block per step,
each between markers:

    <!-- nam:step=capture -->
    ## 1. Need capture
    ...
    <!-- /nam:step=capture -->

`write_step` replaces a step's block when it exists and appends it when it does
not, so running a step again (the officer refined the requirement) rewrites
that step's section and leaves the other steps alone. The header is rebuilt on
every write, so the stage it shows is always the current one.
