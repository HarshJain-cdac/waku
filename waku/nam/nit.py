"""The NIT (Notice Inviting Tender) for a case, built from NRL's template, as a PDF.

The template is nit-forge-ui/src/lib/nit-template.ts, ported row for row: the
same header, the same four sections in the same order, the same row labels
and the same standing-policy wording. That template was reconstructed from
one issued NRL notice (Goods, CPPP, 23.08.2024, PUR-SMT-1008283); one issued
NIT is precedent, not an approved blank, so the provenance prints on the
document itself.

The values come from the case (handoff.payload): the subject, the category,
the approval file, the contract period, the selected PQC clauses and the
items. A row the case does not answer prints [TO BE FILLED], never invented
text: a gap gets filled by a person, a plausible invention gets published.
A row the case leaves empty is suggested, when it can be, from the case's
past tenders in the KG (PQC and SCC wording, the past EMD as a reference),
printed blue with the tender it came from (suggestions()). The KG being down
leaves those rows as gaps; the NIT is still made.
The items go in an annexure with quantity and unit only; the estimate's rates
are internal and never printed.

A NIT is made only on the user's final yes. The chat tool works in two steps:
called without confirm=true it reports what the NIT will contain and has the
model ask "Generate the NIT now?" with ask_options; only after that preview
does confirm=true generate it. A case not yet handed off to NIT (S10) gets a
DRAFT banner instead of passing as the issued notice.

The PDF is written here with the standard library (Helvetica, A4), so no
dependency is added.
