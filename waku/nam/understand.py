"""What the officer's message means in the open flow, read by the model with
the case's whole context, and checked in code before anything happens.

The driver (drive.py) used to decide every in-flow message with word rules:
"i want to chance somthing" became a new case, and "ok" repeated the next
step forever. Rules stay for what is exact (a click on an option, "undo",
"resume NAM-2026-0012", "line 3 rate 500"). Everything else, while a case is
open, is read by the "intent" model task (llm.py), which is given:

  - the case: its id, the need, where it is and what comes next;
  - the question the flow has open, with its options;
  - what the officer can change in the case;
  - the last turns of the chat;
  - the new message, marked as the officer's words.

The model picks one meaning from a closed list and fills only that meaning's
fields. The harness checks the pick (check()): an answer must be one of the
options or the officer's own words, a new need must be made of the message's
words, a change must name something that can be changed, a case id must be
in the message. A refused pick goes back to the model with the reason
(llm.checked), and when no model answers, the driver's rules decide as
before. The model never acts: the harness does what the meaning says.
