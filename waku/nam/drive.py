"""The harness drives Need capture's follow-up questions, not the chat model.

Need capture (capture.py) already decides WHAT to ask, from the KG: it scans
every related past tender and builds one question that tells them apart
(followup.py: a model may propose it, the harness checks it against the
tenders, and the tenders' own facets are the fallback). Nothing there is
written per item.

What was left to the chat model was everything around it: noticing that "i
need tyres" is a need, calling nam_capture_need, showing its question with
ask_options and passing the officer's pick back. Gemma and Qwen did that;
Ministral answered "i need Bimetallic TG" with a rate table and asked
nothing. So the follow-ups depended on which model was loaded.

This module does those steps in code, before the model is called:

  a stated need ("i need X", "procure X")
      -> capture(X); its pending question is shown with ask_options
  a pick, "any" / "skip", or a short answer of their own to that question
      -> capture(answer=...); the next question, or the related tenders
  "stop asking"
      -> capture(skip_followups=True)

Anything else (a question, a lookup, "i need the PQC of ...") returns None
and the turn goes to the model exactly as before. So does a capture the KG
could not run: the harness never makes a turn worse than the model would.

One chat, several cases (chatstate.py keeps the chat's place in state.db):

  a new need stated while this chat's case is still going
      -> asked first: start a new case for it, or carry on with the case
         (or, with a follow-up open, take the words as its answer). The
         ongoing case is never dropped without the officer saying so.
  "resume NAM-2026-0012" / "back to NAM-2026-0012"
      -> that case is this chat's case again, and its open question or next
         step is asked
  a side question while a question is open
      -> the model answers it, and reminder() puts the open question back
