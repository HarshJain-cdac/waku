"""The PR Creation Flow in NAM, as the agent's guide.

NAM raises a Purchase Request for goods in three stages (the manual "PR
Creation Flow in NAM", final version):

  1. Need Identification  the officer says what is needed; NAM finds the
                          matching past purchases, asks until the item is
                          fully described, and the officer picks the items
  2. Estimate creation    the last price of each item, brought up to today
                          at 7% a year, checked, decided and locked
  3. PR Creation          the PR filled from stages 1 and 2, confirmed, and
                          sent to SAP

The main output is the need understood: the materials a job description
names, how many of each SAP holds, the ones the officer takes forward, and
for each of those, one at a time, the one material code (into the cart).
Then the PUR cases that hold the most of the materials, and one PR per cart
item. The estimate is there when the officer asks for it.

The flow is soft: the steps below are what the agent knows and follows, not a
script the harness runs. The agent decides what to do next in the chat, with
its tools; the harness keeps the case (case.py) and enforces only the gates
(the choice before the questions, a material from the records still in, a
flagged price decided and every mandatory field before a PR's confirmation),
each in the tool that passes it (stage_tools.py).

guide(case) is what the agent reads each turn: the manual's steps and, for
the chat's open case, what is done, where it stands and what comes next.
