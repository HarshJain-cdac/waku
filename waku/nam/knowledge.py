"""Knowledge and retrieval (plan Step 13): where each fact of a case comes
from, how far it binds, and a check that none is uncited.

The sources NAM knows, and their authority:

  source               system   authority        connected
  past tenders         kg       precedent        yes (tenders, tender_record, enrichment)
  clause library       kg       precedent        yes: the clauses each past tender issued
                                                 (clauses) and NRL's standing NIT text
                                                 (boilerplate); no clause repository of
                                                 record
  past rates           kg       precedent        yes (price_history): medians of past NRL
                                                 tenders, never the latest rate (R7)
  NRL SOR              -        nrl_schedule     no: the officer types the rate with its
                                                 item reference (schedule=nrl_sor)
  DSR, DAR, APWD, ...  -        reference        no: typed the same way, always with the
                                                 non-NRL alert (R9)
  procurement manual   -        -                no: nothing is answered from it
  NAM policy files     policy/  policy           yes: rule percentages, thresholds, PR
                                                 fields, compliance list (several DRAFT)
  the officer          -        officer          a number or text typed by a named user

Every fact on a case carries one of these. A fact without one is uncited,
and the guardrail `citation` refuses the step that would store it
(guardrails._artifact). Never auto-select a precedent, never invent a rate:
those are the guardrails `precedent` and `rate_source`.

  sources()      the table above, for /v1/nam/health
  authority()    the authority of one fact's source
  facts()        every fact of a set of artifacts with its source and authority
  uncited()      the facts that have none
