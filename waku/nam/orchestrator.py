"""The NAM stage machine (plan D5, D6): which stage a case is in, what it
needs to leave that stage, and who may approve it. Code decides; a flow only
does the work inside its stage.

Each stage S1-S10 (FRS 2.5, SRS 2.4.3) is left only when all of these hold,
in order:

  checks   the work of the stage is on the record: the need is complete and
           its classification confirmed (F4), a precedent is chosen, the flow's artifact is there
  gates    a human approval by a role policy/permissions.json allows
           (quantity, estimate, clauses, documents)
  action   an irreversible act, confirmed by an allowed role: freeze the
           package, submit the PR, approve, hand off to NIT

When the checks pass and a gate or action is still open, the orchestrator
proposes it as the case's one pending action (response `pending_action`,
status needs_approval). It runs only when a caller sends
`confirm: {action_id}` with an allowed role, and only if the case has not
changed since it was proposed; otherwise it is proposed again under a new id.
A flow can never propose one: approvals and irreversible actions come from
this module only (D6).

A stage may be optional (`optional_unless`): while none of its artifacts is
on the case it is passed through, so the PR follows the approved estimate as
the PR Creation Flow says; documents and validation (S5, S6) are the
officer's to start, and once started they are checked like any stage.

A flow may not run ahead of the case's stage (409 stage_gate, saying what is
missing). A flow of an earlier stage may run before the package is frozen;
if it changes the case, the case goes back to that stage and the approvals
from there on must be given again. After the freeze nothing goes back.

The state lives in the Need Record (`workflow`), so a case resumes where it
was after a restart.
