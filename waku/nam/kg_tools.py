"""The knowledge graph's tools and SAP's, two sources the agent uses apart.

  SAP (sap_search)  NRL's SAP purchasing records, on the KG MCP server
                    (WAKU_KG_URL, e.g. http://10.180.148.183:8091/mcp): PR, PO
                    and service lines by item, material code, PR, PO or PUR
                    case. Numbers come from here: how many, which materials,
                    rates, PR and PO numbers.
  KG (kg_*)         NRL's tender knowledge graph (/data2/nrl_dev/Harsh/KG), its
                    read-only precedent API (WAKU_KG_API_URL, default
                    http://127.0.0.1:8077): past tenders, their line items,
                    bidders, clauses and files. A PUR case's own data that
                    SAP's lines do not show comes from here.

Over HTTP, never by importing the KG (its pinned dependencies stay its own),
so the KG restarting never takes Waku down: a tool that cannot reach it says
UNAVAILABLE, never "nothing found". With WAKU_KG_API_URL set to "mcp" the KG
tools read the MCP server instead, through kg_mcp.legacy_get.
