"""quantity.finalise (FRS F10): the case's lines, each with its quantity and
unit, for the officer to approve at the quantity gate (S3).

  1. The first run seeds the lines: the items the officer asked for in need
     capture, each with the quantity and unit they gave (the precedent's
     closest BOQ line gives its material code); without those, every BOQ
     line of the selected precedents (tender_record), with the quantity that
     tender ordered, or the line the guided form described. A quantity taken from a precedent is
     historical: the officer confirms or changes it before approving.
  2. The officer's edits (lines.py) change, add or remove lines:
     answer {question_id: "lines", value: "2: qty=40; add: item=..., qty=5, uom=Nos"}.
     "incomplete: uom=Nos" or "incomplete: remove" acts on every line still
     missing its quantity or unit; "3-40, 52: ..." on several lines.
  3. For a line with no quantity, quantity_history suggests what NRL ordered
     before. A suggestion is shown, never applied.
  3a. answer {question_id: "fill", value: "missing"} fills the incomplete
     lines, each marked with where its value came from:
       - the same item elsewhere on the sheet (its unit), then
       - past data: what NRL ordered before (quantity_history), as many
         lookups as come back within FILL_HISTORY_S, then
       - the AI (the "quantity" model task, llm.py) for the rest, in
         batches within FILL_AI_S; its values are checked in code (a line it
         was asked, a positive number, a short unit) and marked "AI".
     Asking again continues with the lines still missing. The officer still
     confirms every line at the quantity gate.
  4. The lines are the `quantity` artifact, saved after every change. Once
     every line has a positive quantity and a unit it is complete, and the
     stage machine puts the quantity gate to the officer.
