"""need.classify (FRS F4, R1, R28): the officer confirms the case's category,
procurement type and tender type, one question at a time, and is told what
the category decides.

  1. An answer to one of the questions below is checked against its closed
     vocabulary (need.apply_update) and stored as the officer's: confident,
     basis "you set this". An answer outside the vocabulary is bad_request.
     value '' skips the question for now; the next one is asked.
  2. The next question is the first field not confidently settled, in the
     order category, procurement type, tender type. Its options are the
     whole vocabulary, the predicted value first and marked as a suggestion
     with the words that suggested it. A tender type is never settled from
     words alone (need.classify): the officer always answers it.
  3. Once the three are confirmed (the S1 gate, FRS F4), the sub-type is
     offered as one more question. It is not part of the gate, but it picks
     the guided form for Works (F8: New or Repetitive Works).
  4. The route (R1): the estimate flow the category takes, the documents
     its package must hold (policy/guardrails.json), the guided form.

Every change is saved with the field and the value in its reason, so the
history shows who set what (F42). The flow belongs to S1. Run on a case past
S1 it is rework, like any earlier stage's flow (orchestrator.admit): the
stages after S1 are settled again and their approvals given again. After the
freeze it is refused.
