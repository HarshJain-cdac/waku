"""material.suggest (FRS F11): materials or services, with their
specification, suggested from similar past tenders, for the officer to pick
(S3). The "satisfied?" loop of the FRS is the refine answer.

  1. The past tenders matching the need (tenders, lexical, plus any words the
     officer added) give their line items; the closest few give their
     specification clauses verbatim (tender_record).
  2. The officer picks: answer {question_id: "pick", value: "2: use=yes;
     4: use=no"}, or adds search words: answer {question_id: "refine",
     value: "SS316 high pressure"}.
  3. A picked item becomes a line in quantity.finalise, with no quantity
     yet: the officer gives it there. Nothing is picked for the officer.
