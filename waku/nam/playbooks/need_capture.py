"""need.capture (FRS F1, F3, F4, F5, F49): the stated need in, every related
past tender in the KG out, with the follow-up questions that narrow them.

The work itself is waku/nam/capture.py. This file only maps a nam.v1 request
onto it and its output onto the response:

  new case     the last user message is the need ("We need 20 gate valves")
  case_id      the last user message refines the need, unless the need
               already holds those words (a backend that resends the whole
               conversation must not append the same sentence twice)
  answer       answers the open question; the messages are not read as new
               need text, so an answer is never counted twice
  skip         options.skip_questions ends the follow-up questions
  undo         options.undo (a question id) takes that answer, and every
               answer after it, back, and asks the same question again
  category     options.category, the officer's pick before typing (PR flow 1(a))

Status: needs_input while a question is open or the KG found nothing to build
from, ok once NAM can move on: to need.classify while the category,
procurement type or tender type is not confirmed (the S1 gate, F4), else to
the references step (precedent.search).
