"""docs.review (FRS F24): the drafter's review of the generated documents,
before they are approved: the clauses that conflict, and the wording that
leaves a term open (S5).

  1. Code reads every selected clause of every required document, and the
     contract-specific fields (playbooks/checks.py):
       conflict    two places state the same term with different figures
                   (delivery 8 weeks in the SCC, 12 weeks in a field)
       vague       wording that leaves a term to be decided later
                   ("as required", "approx.", "to be decided")
       unclassified a clause neither standard nor contract-specific by its
                   words, for the drafter to place (F22)
  2. The model of the "review" task (waku/nam/llm.py) may add findings the
     code cannot see. It is shown the clauses as data and may only name a
     clause it was shown; a finding that names anything else, or fails the
     output check (guard.py), is dropped. Without a model, the code's
     findings stand alone.
  3. The drafter fixes a finding in docs.generate, or accepts it with a
     reason: answer {question_id: "accept", value: "2: why=both periods are
     intended"}. A conflict not fixed or accepted keeps validation from
     passing (validate, F32).

Findings carry over between runs by their id, with what the drafter decided.
