"""case.plan: a to-do list for the user's query, worked through step by step.

    "Take this need up to the PR"         a list from the case's stage to S7
    "Complete the whole procurement"      ... to the PR submitted (S7): NAM's end
    "Continue"                            the next items of the list

1. The list. From the query the plan reads its goal (the estimate, the
   documents, the validation, the PR by default, the approval, the upload or
   the handoff) and lists the steps from the case's stage to it, in
   the order of the stage machine (S1-S10), the ones the case has already
   done marked done: need capture, classification,
   precedent search and selection, quantity, the estimate for the case's
   category, the documents, their review and the compliance list,
   validation, the freeze, the PR and its submission, the approval, the
   upload, the handoff. It is stored on the case (artifact `todo`), so any
   later call, by any user, continues it. A query naming another goal makes
   a new list.

2. Step by step. Each call runs the list's items in order, each through the
   same path as a call of its own (waku/nam/__init__._execute: the role, the
   stage, the guardrails, the stage machine) and each verified after it
   (verify.py). An item is done only when the case shows it done: its
   verification passed and its own done-check holds on the stored case, or
   the case's stage is past it. The run stops at the first item that cannot
   finish now, and says why:
     needs input      the item's question is the reply's question; answer it
                      with "continue" and the answer goes to that item
     needs approval   the pending gate or action is the reply's; once a user
                      of an allowed role confirms it, "continue" goes on
     not allowed      the item needs another role (the roles are listed);
                      that user sends "continue"
     refused          a guardrail or a gate refused it, with its reasons
   At most MAX_STEPS items run in one call.

3. The list follows the case. Before each run every item is re-read
   against the case: a rework that took the case back makes the items from
   there pending again; when a stage still needs something no item gives
   (no precedent fits: the guided form), the item that gives it is added.

The plan proposes no approval and decides nothing itself: every item is a
flow the officer could have called, and the stage machine still holds every
gate.
