"""need.guided_form (FRS F8, R1, R28): when no past tender fits, the officer
describes the need through the guided form for its category: Goods,
Services, New Works or Repetitive Works (Diagram B).

  1. The case: the one given, or a new one opened from the last user message
     ("Fill the form from scratch: AMC of the cooling towers").
  2. The form: need.classify's route decides it. Until the category is
     confirmed the first question is the category, and for Works until it is
     known to be New or Repetitive, that.
  3. The fields are policy/guided_forms.json, asked one at a time in the
     form's order by waku/tools/flow_engine.py: a field is mandatory, or
     mandatory only after another answer (a material code once the item is
     Codified), or NA once another answer rules it out. Only the next field
     still needing an answer is asked.
  4. An answer is checked before it is stored: an option from the list, a
     positive number, a YYYY-MM-DD date. A wrong one is asked again with the
     reason and stores nothing. value '' skips an optional field (NA); a
     mandatory field skipped is asked again.
  5. The answers are the `guided_form` artifact, saved after every answer so
     the form resumes across calls. Once every field is settled it is
     complete: S1 counts the need as captured and S2 takes it in place of a
     precedent. The sub-type, location, quantity and contract period also go
     onto the Need Record, as the officer's.

A change of category starts the new category's form, keeping the answers to
the fields both forms share.
