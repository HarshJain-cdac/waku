"""document.update (FRS F39): documents edited outside NAM come back to the
case (S9, and S10 until the handoff).

The edited file is uploaded as a new version of its document through the
document endpoints (PUT /v1/nam/documents/{doc}); a corrigendum or another
new file is uploaded to the case (POST). This flow reads what came back
against the frozen package:

  - for each package document with a newer version, how much the edit
    changed it: accuracy 100% when the text is the same, else the share of
    the generated text the edited one kept (word by word);
  - each file added to the case after the freeze;
  - the documents the officer still awaits:
      answer {question_id: "expect", value: "scc, boq"}  ("none" clears it)
    A document awaited and not yet uploaded holds the stage, and the handoff
    (R32).

Every version stays in the document store, so what the officers changed is
kept for later learning (R40), under the store's own retention.
