"""The NAM playbooks: every flow of plan section 3, as data.

A Flow says what the response envelope reports (flow id, FRS numbers,
stage), which case stages it belongs to, the phrasings that route a short
system prompt to it (waku/nam/router.py), the tools it may use, the schema
its `result` must pass, and the handler that does the work. Its instructions
for the model are playbooks/instructions/<flow id>.md, one file per flow, with
a section per category where Goods, Services and Works differ. They replace
SOUL.md for NAM calls.

Every flow is listed here, so every FRS function routes somewhere. A flow
whose handler is None is routed and permission-checked like any other, then
answered with flow_not_built (501): it is built in plan Step 15.
