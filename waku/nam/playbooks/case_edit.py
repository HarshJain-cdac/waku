"""case.edit (FRS F12, F42): the edit screen for the case's own fields, with
the reason for every change, at any stage before the freeze.

  answer {question_id: "edit", value: "all: location=Plant 2, why=the unit moved"}

The fields are the Need Record's: location, term, quantity (as stated) and
the sub-type. Every change needs why=... (F42): it is the reason written to
the case history, with the old and new value, and the audit row of the
call. A field another flow owns is changed there: the category and types in
need.classify, the lines in quantity.finalise, the rates in the estimate,
the clauses in docs.generate. Without an answer the flow shows the fields
and the history of every change made to the case, by whom and why.
