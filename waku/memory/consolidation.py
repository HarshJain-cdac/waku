"""Consolidation — distilling chats into durable memory, but only sometimes.

The whiteboard's diamond: "only consolidate after N new chats". Running a
summarizer after every message is wasteful and noisy; batching N exchanges
gives the summarizer enough context to extract facts worth keeping.

A cheap model reads the unconsolidated chat log and produces:
  - facts   → semantic memory ("Alex prefers morning meetings")
  - episode → episodic memory ("2026-07-10: planned the Acme demo with Alex")

Two checks in code decide what is kept (docs/memory-design.md, sections 4
and 6):
  - only the USER's words can be the source of a fact. Assistant replies
    carry tool output (a tender's text, a web page), and text planted there
    must not become a lasting memory, so they go to the model cut short and
    marked as context, and a fact is kept only when its words are the user's
    (_from_user);
  - a fact is compared with the stored facts most like it (_reconcile): the
    same fact again is skipped, a changed one replaces the old version (which
    the store keeps as history), anything else is added.
Turns the NAM harness ran (_case_flow) are left out: a case's answers live in
the case, not in long-term memory.
