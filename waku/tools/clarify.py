"""ask_options — the agent's way of asking a clarifying question with a fixed
set of choices, instead of guessing, before it calls a tool that CREATES or
GENERATES something on an underspecified request.

This tool doesn't touch state.db or the filesystem. "Running" it means
notifying the observer with the question + options — the SAME event pipe
that already carries gate/tool/text events out through respond()'s observer,
into dashboard.chat_stream's emit, and over SSE to the frontend. No new
plumbing, no change to the loop in agent.py: the model just doesn't call a
create/generate tool this turn, which is already guardrail 1's normal
end-of-turn case.
