"""The intent node — what kind of message is this, decided before the loop runs.

WHY THIS IS NOT AN LLM CALL
---------------------------
The obvious design is to ask a small model "what does the user want?". On this
deployment that is the wrong trade. Measured against the inference endpoint
this Waku talks to, one call costs between 1.6s and 21s — it is a shared vLLM
and the spread is queue time, not compute. An LLM classifier would therefore
put a whole extra queue wait in front of every message, and "Hii" would get
SLOWER, not faster.

So the obvious cases are decided here, from the text, in microseconds:

    "Hii"                  -> greeting   (answer now, no model, no tools)
    "thanks!"              -> greeting
    "yes" / "ok" / "go"    -> greeting only before Waku's first reply; after
                              it, an answer: full loop with the chat so far
    "generate a NIT"       -> nit        (the wizard owns this turn)
    "what did we pay for   -> kg         (knowledge-graph lookup; the diagram
     gaskets last time?"                  lights its KG block for this)
    anything else          -> task       (the full loop, unchanged)

Only `greeting` short-circuits. `nit` and `kg` are labels: they steer nothing
on their own, they tell the harness diagram and the trace what this turn is
about, and they are the signal the KG block lights on. Everything that is not
a confident match falls through to the full loop exactly as before — this node
can remove latency, never capability.

That is the same order the rest of this project uses when it has a choice:
deterministic rules first, a model only for what rules genuinely cannot do
(see waku/tools/aan_reader.py, and the KG's own doc_classifier.py).
