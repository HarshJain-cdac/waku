"""Serving the archived tender documents behind a purchase-case reference.

When a procurement officer reads "PUR-MNTPLN-1005566" in a NAM or NiT
conversation, the useful next action is to open the notice and check it. That
is what makes a citation verifiable rather than merely quotable — and this
whole system's credibility rests on citations that can be checked.

The knowledge graph knows where every file lives (FileOccurrence.original_path,
19,000+ of them across the corpus); this module turns that into bytes. Nothing
is generated, converted or summarised: the officer gets the file NRL issued.

SAFETY
------
The case reference arrives from a URL, and the response is a file read from a
shared corpus. So the path is never built from the reference — it comes back
from the graph, and is then checked to be inside the corpus root before it is
opened. A reference that resolves outside the corpus is refused, whatever the
graph says.
